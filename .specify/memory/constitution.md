# 🏛️ Project Constitution — Speckit SaaS Demo

## Purpose
Define principles and standards for building a professional, maintainable, AI-aided SaaS web app using Windsurf and Spec-Kit.

## Core Philosophy
1. Follow **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** — specs define what and why before code defines how.
2. Maintain **Clean Architecture** and **SOLID principles** across backend (.NET 8) and frontend (React + TypeScript).
3. Treat all AI outputs as *drafts* — human review is required before merge.

## Technical Standards
- **Backend:** .NET 8 Web API with minimal APIs and layered architecture.  
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript with Styled Components.  
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (free tier).  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub.  
- **CI/CD:** Render + Vercel free tier.  
- **Containers:** Docker for local and production parity.

## Code Quality
- All code changes require a spec → plan → task traceability link.  
- 80 % + unit test coverage for backend services.  
- Use ESLint + Prettier for frontend formatting.

## Documentation
- All major features must include a “Feature Walkthrough” in `specs/feature-walkthroughs.md`.  
- Embed help content (knowledge cards, tooltips) within the app to guide users.

## Collaboration
- Pull requests require at least one human review.  
- Keep Constitution + Specs updated as code evolves.
