\# 📘 Base Spec — Speckit SaaS Demo



\## Project Summary

A \*\*fake SaaS web app\*\* built for demonstration and learning purposes.  

It simulates a professional product like a Task Tracker, Budget Planner, or CRM-lite — complete with feature walkthroughs, in-app guidance, and embedded help content.

\## Objectives

\- Demonstrate \*\*Spec-Kit + Windsurf\*\* workflow from idea → spec → plan → tasks → implementation.

\- Build a realistic yet lightweight full-stack app (React + .NET + MongoDB).

\- Include embedded \*\*knowledge cards\*\*, \*\*tooltips\*\*, and \*\*process guidance\*\*.

\- Provide feature walkthroughs like “How to create a task” or “How to invite teammates.”
